    <h2 align='center'>Implementation of Sorting Algorithms</h2>
    <h3 align='center'>By <a href="https://isaacattuah.com/">Isaac K. Attuah</a></h3>

    <p class>This program sorts numbers using the following algorithms:</p>
    <ul class>
        <li>Bubble Sort</li>
        <li>Insertion Sort</li>
        <li>Quick Sort</li>
        <li>Merge Sort</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Only the sorted array (comparisons) will be shown for input sizes above 16 elements. Total number of steps are
            always indicated at the end of the output.</b></p>
    <p><b>Press Clear after each iteration of Quick and Merge Sort to reset their respective counters.</b></p>

    <p id="essay">The aim of this lab was to test the number of comparisons made by different algorithms based on the
        number
        of
        input values that were passed to each algorithm. The input values were 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400,
        450, 500. By observation, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort had a noticeable delay in displaying
        output however Merge Sort remained the most consistent throughout the testing process. Insertion, Merge Sort
        and Bubble Sort were the stable sorting techniques whereas Quick Sort was not. Merge Sort was the only
        algorithm that split the problems into multiple arrays hence it had a better advantage over the other
        algorithms in terms of working with the console.log output of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>The graph above confirms that the average time complexities of each of the algorithms.
        Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort where both O(n^2) and Merge Sort and Quick Sort were both O(nlogn). The
        behavior of the graph showed that Quick Sort was the fastest for all the input values provided.</p>
    <p>The individual sorting algorithms work in their own unique ways. The list below shows how each sorting
        technique works including some key differences in their operations</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Bubble Sort</b>: Bubbles largest elements to the end of list</li>
        <li><b>Insertion Sort</b>: Inserts elements in their rightful position creating sorted array portion till entire
            array is sorted</li>
        <li><b>Merge Sort</b>: Uses Divide and Conquer technique to sort arrays in smaller arrays and returns a sorted
            array as output</li>
        <li><b>Quick Sort</b>: A random element is made a pivot and elements on the left- and right-hand side are
            compared
            to this pivot. Elements smaller than the pivot go to the left-hand side and elements larger than pivot
            go to the right-hand side. </li>
    </ol>
